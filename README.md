## About

The goal of this project is to develop intelligent path-planning techniques for autonomous systems delivering pizza. By combining Reinforcement Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Model-Based Formal Methods, we aim to create efficient and validated path plans that navigate through grid maps while avoiding obstacles.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **RL_Pizza_Delivery:** Contains the core implementation, including a working training script for the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search.
- **data/config:** Configuration files used for training the PPO, and DQN agent.
- **scripts:** Additional scripts and utilities related to the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RL_Pizza_Delivery.git
   cd RL_Pizza_Delivery
